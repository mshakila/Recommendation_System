# Recommendation_System
The problem was to recommend books based on the book dataset.

I have solved this using both R and Python. 
In R, I have used popular method, UBCF and IBCF methods. Here used cosine similarity matrix. 
Also used evaluation scheme to find  goodness of the model.

In Python, I used based on highest rating count, highest mean rating. I used IBCF for a single user 
(as computation intensive) using correlation similarity matrix. I have also done filtering.

The small dataset has 10,000 records and I have used this in R programming.  
For python, I have used instead a larger dataset. 
The large book dataset contains 1.1 million ratings of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
